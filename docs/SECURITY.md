# Security, Confidentiality & Isolation Model — Distributed Lease-Based Job Scheduler (Java 21)

## 1. Enterprise NDA & Intellectual Property Compliance
All production codebases developed for enterprise employers and commercial clients remain strictly within private corporate version control systems under NDA. This repository is a **clean-room reference implementation** focusing strictly on generalizable distributed systems patterns and domain invariants.

## 2. Architectural Security Controls
1. **Strict Tenant & Context Validation:** Every operation validates caller and tenant context before mutating or returning state, preventing cross-tenant data leakage.
2. **Idempotency & Replay Protection:** State-mutating workflows enforce idempotency keys and deterministic state transitions to guard against duplicate event replay.
3. **Zero Embedded Secrets or Proprietary Schemas:** Contains strictly clean-room domain logic and synthetic verification vectors.
